The system/service is for collecting candidates' application for a certain program as created or defined by the employee. The service's scope/features are as follows:
1. Employee create the program and set the questions for the candidate to apply
2. The candidate applies by filling his/he personal information and also answers some additional questions.
3. The service is well protected via "api-key", an authentication protocol
4. Writing unit test to ensure the service passes the implementation
5. The database used for this project is the Azure Cosmos Database (new to me)
In conclusion, the service tried as much as possible to meet all standards of  clean coding and "KIS".
